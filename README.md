# portfolio-about-me

<h1>Homework for 3/22/2020</h1>

<p> In this assignment I have created a multi paged websites with a navbar to a "about me" page, a "portfolio" page, and a "contact" page.
The main tool used for this assignment was bootstrap, vs code, and plenty of googling and research. The site is to be responsive via bootstrap and must use semantic HTML.
The site also contains the correct bio information for myself.</p>
